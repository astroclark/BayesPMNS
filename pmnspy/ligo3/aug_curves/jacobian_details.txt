Given a figure of merit , S, dependent on the noise (the SNR, some effective
distance, etc),

we compute, for a given type of noise N

d log S / dx = log(S_2 / S_1)/dx

where S_2 is the value of S in the regime where N is reduced, and S_1 is either
the value where N is increased, or the baseline.

If the noise is quantum (mass, pow, sqz, loss), then S_1 = baseline and dx = 0.2
for the noise curves that Sarah computed. Otherwise, dx = 0.4 and S_1 is the
increased noise.

All of the noise curves are in CCSN/PSDs
